Prisoners Dilemma Battlearena - which algorithm can get most points?

The prisoner's dilemma is a game theory thought 
experiment that involves two rational agents, each 
of whom can COORPERATE for mutual benefit or betray 
their partner ("defect") for individual reward.

YOUR algorithm goes in the contender.py-file. You then go to main and pit it against another contender or itself.
